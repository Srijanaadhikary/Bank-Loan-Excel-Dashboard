# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis ( Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The primary objective of the Detail Dashboard is to provide a compreshive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detail insights into our loan portfolio, bprrower profiles, and loan performance.


I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyse the data. This process involved several stages, including dat processing, data cleaning, and data visualisation.
